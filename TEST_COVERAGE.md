## Running Tests

```bash
cd server
npm test              # Watch mode
npm run test:run      # Run once
npm run test:ui       # Visual UI
```

## Next Steps for Refactoring

Now that we have tests, we can safely refactor to add:
1. Room system (5 isolated rooms)
2. Admin authentication
3. Tournament mechanics

The tests will catch any regressions in core game logic!

## Test-Driven Refactoring Approach

1. âœ… Write tests for existing behavior
2. âœ… Ensure all tests pass (GREEN)
3. ðŸ”„ Refactor code (add rooms)
4. âœ… Run tests - they should still pass
5. âž• Add new tests for new features (rooms, admin)
6. âœ… Implement new features until tests pass

This way we never break existing gameplay while adding new features!
